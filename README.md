# Spam or Ham Classifier
## Introduction
Welcome to the Spam or Ham Classifier project readme file! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model can automatically filter out unwanted spam emails, improving email management efficiency.
## Data Collection 
Gathering a labeled dataset consisting of emails categorized as spam or ham.
## Preprocessing
Cleaning and preprocessing the email data to prepare it for modeling.
## Feature Extraction
Extracting relevant features from the email text using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
## Model Training
Training machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression or Naive Bayes, on the labeled dataset to classify emails.
## Model Evaluation
Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and accuracy score on a validation dataset.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Spam or Ham Classifier project provides a streamlined solution for email filtering using TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression. By harnessing these simple yet effective techniques, the project offers an efficient method for distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails, enhancing productivity and security. With its straightforward approach and reliable performance, it stands as a valuable tool for users seeking to manage their email communication effectively, without the need for complex NLP algorithms.
